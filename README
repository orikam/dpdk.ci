DPDK has a distributed Continuous Integration (CI) system.

It is discussed in the mailing list ci@dpdk.org.


When are run the tests?
-----------------------

The tests can be run at any time:
- manually
- regularly to monitor a git tree
- after each patch submission to avoid accepting a bad patch


Where are run the tests?
------------------------

The tests can be run anywhere:
- in a private lab
- in a public/reference lab

There is no reference lab yet.


How to view CI results?
-----------------------

The test of a patch is viewable in patchwork (http://dpdk.org/dev/patchwork)
if the report has been sent from a trusted lab.
The patchwork overview shows a counter column S/W/F for Success/Warning/Failure.
A bad performance can be seen as a failure.
More details are found in the detailed view of a patch.

Every test reports can be seen at http://dpdk.org/ml/archives/test-report/.

There is no summarized view of regular or manual tests yet.


How to add a CI report?
-----------------------

A test report can be sent to test-report@dpdk.org.
The sender must be trusted (whitelisted) by dpdk.org.

If a report has the format of a "per-patch" test,
it is automatically integrated in patchwork.
